# Usage
This is a Google Chrome extension with 3 modes:

<img width="270" height="166" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c81ed65-d11c-4435-a50f-8d346bfcbce0" />

1. Shorts are fully hidden from recommendations (works for both main page and recommendations on a video)
2. Shorts are recommended, but clicking them opens them in the traditional video player instead of the Shorts infinite scroller
3. Extension is disabled

Switching mode should not require page reload. Please file an issue if otherwise observed.
